##Project Overview
A social mobile app that allows people to express their emotions and experiences locally. On launching *Moments*, users are prompted to sign in via Facebook and are then taken to a a full-view map centered on their location that is dynamically updated in real-time through Firebase. Users can view moments from around the world and are able to create their own moments: brief snapshots of their mood or experiences represented by Momoji, an optional short description (up to 30 characters) and/or photo.

##Installation Instructions
Moments is built in Swift 2.0 and requires Xcode 7.3 to be run locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BjoernWagner/moments
$ cd moments
$ pod install
$ open moments.xcworkspace/
```
In Xcode use `cmd + R` to run the code through the simulator of your choice.
Enter `cmd + U` to run the tests.

##Known Issues
- Latest image upload sometimes overwrite existing moments' images. 
- Unable to display standard subtitle details (user's name and timestamp) if image uploaded; image overwrites subtitle.
- Images currently uploaded synchronously to AWS S3; app will crash if user tries to create moment before upload is complete. 
- Inability to interact with moments that were created without text.
- UI constraints do not render UI elements correctly across devices. Currently works on 4.7-inch and larger screens.
- Momoji map markers do not always match user's choice when they were created.
